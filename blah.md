Brandon's tenure with the team began amidst a unique set of challenges: inheriting a nascent team of two engineers, all of whom, including their manager, were navigating the complexities of a new company. Undeterred, he not only spearheaded the project build-out but also provided pivotal guidance to help the engineers adeptly navigate through the multifaceted company landscape. A notable achievement under his leadership was the successful onboarding of a new API—a task that had seen previous attempts by other teams falter. This success was not without its hurdles, necessitating collaborative efforts across various teams and multiple Lines of Business (LOBs), yet through strategic navigation and team collaboration, the endeavor was triumphant. When Brandon joined, the team was notably hindered by a lack of access to downstream APIs and an AWS environment for deployment. Demonstrating innovative leadership, he unblocked the team by introducing Docker and mocks, enabling them to commence building their solution and subsequently develop a Proof of Concept (POC) for our API shortly after his arrival. In the absence of a dedicated product owner, Brandon seamlessly assumed the dual roles of product owner and technical product owner, ensuring that the product’s development and technical integrity were not compromised. Furthermore, he embraced the role of Agile Lead with diligence and efficacy. In a climate where Cyber continues to prioritize rigorous Agile practices, and with the company’s decision to eliminate this role, Brandon stepped up to safeguard the team’s focus on product development, embodying a multifaceted leadership that has been instrumental in navigating through a year of challenges and achievements
