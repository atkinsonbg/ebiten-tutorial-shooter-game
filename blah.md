- I help lead the XXX community of practice at the company. This involves setting up demos, crafting POCs, and working with teams struggling with XXX. This commitment helps other teams leverage XXX and speed up their development efforts as well as reduce time to market with better solutions.
- I have participated in the YYY program which helps better understand the engineering community and the struggles they fave at the company. I have participated in two sessions, providing feedback and opinions on new services and platforms meant to help our engineers.
